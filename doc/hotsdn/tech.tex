\section{Technical Design}
In this section, we will introduce the design principles of our system. We begin by discuss the stack of our system. Then examine the problems in current OpenFlow design which make it unsuitable for high performance networks and propose our solutions. Following that, we describe the the methods to maximize the throughput of latency-sensitve applications and reduce the straggler large flows

\subsection{system stack}

\begin{itemize}
\item API
\item Flow Controller
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{challenges in openflow}

1. involves controllers too often, those latency-sensitive flows will be suffered from it 


\subsubsection{solution}

application table (deadline): static(intialized when warming up of switches) 

dynamic table : job input information: priority, and flows input size

\begin{itemize}
\item for latency sensitive services applications, locating it in static one, operators should setup it manually, openflow controller sync the application information with the routers when warming up)
\item for large ones, when invoking flows, the flow size is known by the controller through API, assigning rate according to input 
\end{itemize}
